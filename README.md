In high school I had this idea of a thing I wanted to build. I wanted to make a thing that got roms out of GBA cartridges. 
I had no idea what knowledge I needed to gain to be able to execute on it. two degrees and three employers latter I knew enough to start this project. 
at this point, people have figured out this problem almost completely. but I still wanted to do it myself. 

I got my solution to the point of reading data out of the roms but then lost intereset, I had completed most of what I wanted to. 
because this problem has been solved by others, I did not need to get funcitong game files just some meaningfull data indicating my sytem worked.

partly I gave up to spend time looking for a new job.
now that I am not on the search for a better job, I am going to re-start this project. 

inital commits are what I found on my computer that I think were relevant. there may be more.
